A non-invasive method of detecting and tracking the user's heart rate, through the use of a webcam or camera device.

Current methods of measuring heart rate involve conducting tests such as electrocardiograms or the use of pulse oximeters. Alternative methods have been greatly explored in recent years, and developments in non-contact heart rate measurement are being researched across the globe.

Video-based heart rate monitoring is an inexpensive method that aims to monitor heart rate in a minimally invasive manner and technological advancements in computer vision have enabled this method to be a viable approach.

This program uses facial recognition and tracking, RGB channel isolation, signal filtering and Fourier Transforms, to output the average heart rate of the user within an accuracy of +-10%.
